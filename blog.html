            I have been an avid supporter of congestion pricing since I first learned about it a couple years ago. As someone who grew up my entire
            life in New York City without a car, I rely on public transportation and my bike to get around the city. With the majority of New Yorkers
            not owning a car, it always amazes me how much we prioritize the car over everything else in New York.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">
            Streets such as 5th Avenue in midtown are jam packed with people on the sidewalk, often so much so that it is dangerous, while cars still
            take up the majority of the street and move orders of magnitude fewer people. Why do we allow our city to be like this?
          </p>
          <p class="blog-text">
            It is clear that we need to reform the use of space on our streets in NYC and especially Manhattan, but progress on improving it moves at
            a snailâ€™s pace. In order to truly improve things on our streets, we need to reduce the number of cars clogging up our streets. Most people
            agree that this has to be accomplished with both the carrot and the stick: in other words, we simultaneously need to make alternatives to
            driving better and we need to discourage driving.
